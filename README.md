#Bookmarks

This is my first ReactJS adventure. In two nights, I've been able to completely rewrite the frontend of my personal bookmarks website, you can see it live at https://bks.simonelippolis.com

The backend that powers the site is base on my PHP Boilerplate, you can have a look at it here: https://github.com/leeppolis/php-boilerplate

The code contained in this repository is:

- The first attempt at a new JS library
- Not to be considered production-ready

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
